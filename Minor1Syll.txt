Some of you have been asking which parts of the text book to read for the minor. 
You should definitely read everything from the beginning of the textbook (Peterson & Davie) up to and including Ch. 2.2.

In addition, you need to be familiar with all the material discussed in class. 
We will cover material of DLL and higher layers in subsequent classes. 
Reading the chapters on those layers from the textbook is not essential for the minor, 
but you need to know at least the brief intro given to those layers in class.
